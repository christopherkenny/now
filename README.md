## Creating a New Article

To create a new article using this format:

```bash
quarto use template christopherkenny/now
```

This will create a new directory with an example document that uses this format.

## Using with an Existing Document

To add this format to an existing document:

```bash
quarto add christopherkenny/now
```

Then, add the format to your document options:

```yaml
format:
  now-pdf: default
```    

## Options

This template supports standard author and affiliation schema.
For affiliations, please ensure that you use numeric IDs for codes, or they will print with extra text.

Standard fields, as listed below, are also supported:

- `title`: Title of your article
- `abstract`: Abstract of your article
- `keywords`: Keywords for your article
- `bibliography`: a path to your bibliography file, e.g. `references.bib`
- `acknowledgements`: Acknowledgements for your article

Note that acknowledgements *only* show if there is a corresponding author due to limitations of the underlying LaTeX template.

Each of these should be placed under the `journal:` name.

For example,

```yaml
journal:
  name: "Journal of Example Studies"
```
