## Introduction {#sec-intro}

Thank you for using this Quarto template to write your article. 
This Quarto template is unofficial and builds on `now`'s 2024 LaTeX template.

Your introduction goes here! 
Some examples of commonly used commands and features are listed below, to help you get started.

Since we are in Quarto, you can cite with an `@` symbol, like @knuth1984texbook for prose or [@knuth1984texbook] for parentheticals.
As seen below, you can mix markdown and Latex with each other, though it's likely best to mostly use markdown.

Use section (`#`) and subsection (`##`) commands to organize your document.
LaTeX and Quarto handle all the formatting and numbering automatically.
Use the `@` commands for cross-references (not just cites).

# Using this template {#sec-template}

Some examples of commonly used commands and features are listed below, to help you get started.

You can mix Quarto's markdown syntax and Latex with each other, though it's likely best to mostly use markdown.

Major features are illustrated below:

## Cross Referencing

To reference a figure with example label "plot" (@fig-1), use `@fig-plotlabel`. 
Analogously, to reference a table with example label "data", use `@tbl-data`.
To reference a section, such as the Introduction (@sec-intro), use `@sec-intro`.

For complete information on cross referencing with Quarto, see <https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/cross-references.html>.

## Citations

Quarto formats citations and references automatically using the bibliography records in your .bib file. 
For a citation in parentheses use [@greenwade93]. 
Multiple citations can be given as [@greenwade93;@knuth1984texbook].

# Including code

```{r}
#| label: fig-sepal
#| fig-cap: "According to ChatGPT, the Iris data set is a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning and statistics, often used for benchmarking algorithms. It consists of 150 observations of iris flowers from three species: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica. Each observation includes four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, all measured in centimeters. This dataset is particularly useful for classification tasks as the species are distinct and easily separable based on the given measurements. In R, the dataset can be accessed using the datasets package with the command data(iris)."
plot(iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Sepal.Width)
```

## Subfigures

Figures can be placed using LaTeX or using [Quarto's figure syntax](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/figures.html).
To make a figure, try:

![Caption for the figure 1.]({{< placeholder 100 100 format=png >}}){#fig-1}

Or to generate a figure with subfigures:

::: {#fig-subfig1 layout-ncol=2 cap-location=bottom}

![fig a]({{< placeholder 100 100 format=png >}}){#fig-sub1-a}

![fig b]({{< placeholder 100 100 format=png >}}){#fig-sub1-b}

Caption for the subfigures 1.

$$ 3 + 3 \cdot \epsilon $$
